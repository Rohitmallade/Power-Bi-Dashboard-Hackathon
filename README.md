# Power-Bi-Dashboard-Hackathon
**Analysis Of Flight Delays**

Problem Statement:
Develop a Power BI dashboard to predict and analyze flight delays of 15 minutes or
more at arrival airports. This dashboard aims to assist airlines, passengers, and
airports in optimizing operations, resource management, and travel planning. It will
visualize delay distribution, identify high-delay airports, explore distance-related
impacts, examine carrier-specific delays on January 1st, and reveal patterns in
departure time blocks. The dashboard will also provide insights into weekly delays,
carrier scheduling variations, origin-destination delay averages, seasonal trends, the
relationship between departure and arrival delays, and identify airports or carriers
with high cancellation or diversion rates. These insights will distinguish this airline's
performance from others.
